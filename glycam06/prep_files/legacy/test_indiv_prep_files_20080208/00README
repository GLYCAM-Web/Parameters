Made slight file-path-type modifications to Austin's script.  My charge-change 
program doesn't add a final "STOP", so I added them manually and re-ran his
script.  As a double-check that all worked (since I altered the program a
little bit), I used the following:

ls */*leapinput > LEAPINPUT.ls
ls */*top > TOP.ls
wc LEAPINPUT.ls TOP.ls
 1071  1071 27180 LEAPINPUT.ls
 1071  1071 20754 TOP.ls
 2142  2142 47934 total

...so it looks ok.

This directory will contain the final, checked prep files.  Subdirectories will
contain output regarding the checks.  The directory "chargediff" contains details
of the files for which the charges still differed after Austin's checks for typos
and other similar inconsistencies.  See more info below (***).

The prep files have been checked to ensure that:

1] D & L forms (mirror images) have identical charges on each atom.  See below
	for more details on this (***).

2] Equivalent residues are present in the D & L file forms.

3] Residue charges sum to the proper number.

4] Each prep entry will be processed by tleap without errors.  (Note that
this does not mean the finer points of geometry, etc., have been checked.)

These checks were performed by programs written by Austin Yongye and me.
There is a little overlap between the two, but mainly:

Lachele's: #'s 1 & 2  (& 3, but not very obviously)
	to check them:  /home/lachele/software/compare_DL_prep_charges/compare_DL_prep
	to change charges to averages (or, with small edit, to D or L): 
		/home/lachele/software/change_DL_prep_charges/change_chg_DL_prep

Austin's: #'s 3 and 4
	glycam:/home/lachele/Austin_CHECK_PREPS_12172007/zcheck_preps.pl


*** Regarding D & L charges:

The following files contained D/L charge differences that were due to
separate MD simulations, and therefore, were within statistical error
of each other.  In each case, they were assigned either the D or the L
charges, whichever was the first to be derived.

Charge columns are
Name Type D-charge L-charge difference(Dchg-Lchg) percent-diff(100*(Dchg-Lchg)/Dchg)
