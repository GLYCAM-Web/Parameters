This directory contains information relevant to the amino acid
residues commonly used for linking sugars to proteins.  The prep
files have been outdated, but they are included here for completeness.
The proper files to use are the library files.

# BLFoley

	Changed N to N3 for OLS and OLT in one or two N-terminal libraries.

# BLFoley
Files in this directory as of 20090508:

        Prep files for mid-chain and terminal residues:
		Glycam_06_amino.in     
		Glycam_06_aminont.in
		Glycam_06_aminoct.in   

        Off libraries for mid-chain and terminal residues:
		Glycam_06_amino.lib      
		Glycam_06_aminont.lib
		Glycam_06_aminoct.lib  

	README (this file)

	Reason for this change:  Found disagreement in atom types between OLT and
		COLT residues in the library.  Changing for OLS, OLT in the prep and 
		library files.  Changing all to be "OG1" as in the mid-chain file.
