Rule 1 (20110830 BLF) 

	Only prep files should be named "*.prep".

	Reason: 
		The ../cat_preps.sh script uses these files.

Rule 2 (20110830 BLF)

	Place earlier versions of prep files in the "previous_versions"
		subdirectory.  That is, if you make a file called
		Residue-2.prep, then the files Residue.prep and 
		Residue-1.prep should be in that directory.

	Reason:
		The ../cat_preps.sh script requires only current and 
		usable prep files be in this directory and that they
		all be named "*.prep".
