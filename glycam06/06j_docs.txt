Documentation for GLYCAM_06j

LEAPRC files

* The main leaprc file was updated to reflect the new parameters.
    This file is compatible with ff10.

* The additional, 12SB leaprc file was updated similarly.
    This file is compatible with ff12SB.

PREP and LIB files

* The atom type for CA was changed to CX.
    This change makes it compatible with ff10, ff13, ff12SB and ff13SB.

* A mistake in the ZOLT prep file was corrected so tht the atom types
    for HG21, HG22 & HG23 are HC (rather than Hc).  
    This ensures compatibility with protein force fields.

* A set of lib files was generated with atom types compatible with
    ff12SB and ff13SB.

PARAMETER files

* Parameters were added so that ff10 and ff13 are supported.

* "use by permission only" was removed from the Ho van der Waals term.
