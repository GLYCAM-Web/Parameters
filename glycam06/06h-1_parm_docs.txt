This update corrects a typographical error in the MEX residue.  The charge was incorrectly
assigned to H1 when it should have been CH3.

More information:

	After the change in glycan atom type names, protein-linkage 
	parameters had to be recast for the new atom type names.  A few 
	entries relevant to linkages between glycans and proteins, where a 
	mix of type names was required, were missed.  These have been added. 

	Parameters were also added to reflect atom type names and values
	appropriate to the ff12SB force field.  These entries should not 
	conflict with entries for other force fields as long as the atom 
	type names remain orthogonal.

	Note:

	To use the ff12SB parameters, use the library files versioned
	06h-ff12SB.  The file leaprc.GLYCAM_06h-12SB facilitates this.
