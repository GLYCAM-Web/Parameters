The 06j-1 parameter set now makes ff12SB into the default compatible
protein force field.

* The leaprc was changed in these ways:

	It now loads amino acid libraries for ff12SB 
	It now loads the new 06j-1 prep file
	It now loads the atomic_ions.lib, the updated ions library

* The prep file was incremented to 06j-1 as well because the ZOLT and
	ZOLS entries now have atom types to match ff12SB.
