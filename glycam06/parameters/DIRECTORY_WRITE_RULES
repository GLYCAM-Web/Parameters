Write rules for directory:

/usr/local/programs/glycam06/parameters


Rule 1 (20080221) 

Make sure that only glycam parameter files are named as:

Glycam_*.dat

-- Note that the documentation file is named "Glycam06_alldocs.txt" which
	lacks an underscore after "Glycam".

This is needed for the AMBER parameter to CHARMM parameter converter, parm2prm.
The source for the converter is parm2prm.c.  The converter is part of a larger 
package, AMB2CHM.  The package is called when a user requests output from the 
web tool be in CHARMM format.  The AMB2CHM package, including the parm2prm.c
source, can be found in this directory tree:

/usr/local/programs/tomcat/webapps/AMB2CHM

The source uses the file names and their creation date to determine the version
of the glycam parameters (e.g., "Glycam_06b.dat", "Glycam_06c.dat", etc.) that
is identical to "Glycam_06_current.dat".  The program will write an error 
message in the user files if there is any file of type "Glycam_*.dat" that is
more recent than "Glycam_06_current.dat".

I will happily receive suggestions for more elegant methods (lfoley@uga.edu).

Rule 2 (20080221)

Place only documentation text files in Parm_Docs.  cat_parm_docs.sh uses
the files in that directory.
