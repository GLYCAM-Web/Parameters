#### Change log for 2012-02-08 ####
All atom types were changed to match the new AMBER standard where
GLYCAM-specific atom types are denoted by a new format.  In the new format,
atom-types with two characters are denoted "Ab" where "A" is capitalized and
"b" is lowercase.  Cross-over terms, when force fields are mixed, maintain the
formatting appropriate to the atom types for each force field being mixed.
Atom types specific to various force fields have been included in the AMBER
Tools manual for reference.

# Updated N-Sulfate terms to correct H-N-C-H torsion definitions for
# sugar-models.  Originally developed with THP models.
