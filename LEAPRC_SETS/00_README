This directory contains complete* parameter sets associated with specific
leaprc files.  Because we version all files now, it will be possible to
determine the most recent set, and that information should supersede any
dates assigned to the files.  That is, a set for an older leaprc might
get made at a date later than a new one.  

* Complete means all the parameters supplied by GLYCAM.  Additional files
associated with solvent, ions or protein are not included.
